# SVM-implementation
a support vector machine implementation using different optimization approaches without the use of prebuilt models for classification of the MNIST dataset

This project was developed by me and a collegue during the course of optimization methods for machine learning, all the details and results of the implementation are reported into the report file.
The most intresting results are the ones obtained in Q4.
